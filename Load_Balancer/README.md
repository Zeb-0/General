# Load Balancer
When you have an enterprise or website that gets a lot of hits, you may run into an overload problem. In that case you will need to distribute the load across multiple servers.  
This is where a load balancer comes in handy.

The Load balancer will distribute the workload across multiple individual systems or group of systems thus reducing the amount of worl load on an individual system.

This consequently increases reliability, efficiency and availability of your enterprise APP.
